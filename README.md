ðŸš€ **Projectile Launcher with Automated Trajectory Adjustment | Embedded Systems Project**

Proud to share my recent project where I designed and built a **Projectile Launcher** integrating **embedded systems and mechanical design**. This project involved multiple stages, from CAD modeling to physical mechanism assembly and coding for automation.

### Key Highlights:
- **Distance Measurement:** Utilized an **ultrasonic sensor** to measure the distance to the target.
- **Trajectory Calculation:** Developed logic to calculate the projectile trajectory based on the measured distance.
- **Stepper Motor Control:** Integrated a **Stepper Motor** to adjust the launch angle precisely.
- **Projectile Launching:** Automated launching mechanism that fires the projectile towards the target.

### Development Process:
1. **CAD Modeling:** Designed a detailed CAD model in **SolidWorks** to visualize the mechanism.
2. **Physical Mechanism:** Assembled the physical launcher, overcoming mechanical challenges during the process.
3. **Embedded Integration:** Integrated motors, sensors, and other components into the mechanism.
4. **Programming:** Coded the system using **Energia IDE** for **Tiva C Series Microcontroller** to control the entire mechanism.

### Key Learnings:
- Hands-on experience in **mechanical design and embedded system integration**.
- Overcame **mechanical and electrical challenges** to achieve precision.
- Developed **trajectory calculation algorithms** for accurate projectile targeting.

This project strengthened my skills in **CAD design, motor control, sensor integration, and embedded programming**.

Excited to work on more interdisciplinary projects that combine **mechanical engineering** and **embedded systems**.
